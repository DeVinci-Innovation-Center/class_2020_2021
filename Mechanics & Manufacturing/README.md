# Mechanics & manufacturing

The objective of this lecture is for you to be able to understand any given mechanical system, explain it and or make it with the tools at your disposal.

I tried to make the chapter themes driven but you'll see that tons of it overflow on each other

In each chapter you'll find the slides, the exercises and the bibliography relevant for the day. the bibliography comes in two (2) types : Books reference and YouTube links. The YouTube links are good for discovering the subjects but I cannot urge you enough to read or at least take a look at the books ! (plus they are in french)

One last thing : in the section 00 you'll find a glossaire for Industrial design, it could be really helpful to print it out !
