# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction (FAQ)

**Why a lesson about data structures ?**

> Data Structures are the base component of any working piece of software. Without data structures and algorithms, we simply would not be able to do computer science, or at least not in a efficient way.

**Is this not the same thing as the "Programming" lesson ?**

> If knowing C and Python is being able to talk to a computer, then Data Structures and Algorithms are knowing what to tell it. This lesson is fundamentally different and on a higher abstraction level. The concepts seen in this lesson can apply to any programing language.

**What programming language should I use ?**

> It entirely depends on the end goal of your project. If you seek speed, maybe C is a good bet, if you seek maintainability and quick development time, Python might be a good start. Sometimes you can even break your problem in multiple programs which are made using different languages.
