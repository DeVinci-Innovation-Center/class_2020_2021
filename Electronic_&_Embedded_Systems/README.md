## I. The architecture

### 1) Bibliography

Here is the template for each chapter :

----------------------------------------------

## Books
Here you can find different book or class online. I advise you to use them, most of the course come from them.
It's not obligatory to read them, but if you need to go deeper it's must do
## Resources

### Name of the section
You need to work on each section.
#### level 1
All the resources in this level are obligatory. You need to use them all and understand them.
#### level 2
All the resources in this level are optional. I advise to work on them as you will need them for the project, and can have question on them during QCM (less than level 1).
## Miscellaneous
Just a bunch of useful or funny things I found, totally optional

----------------------------------------------


### 2) Courses

3 things to know:

* Our class time is extremely limited. In consequence, the lecture will be fast and based on the idea that you are aware of the subject, thanks to the bibliography.
* Prepare the lecture with the bibliography BEFORE the lecture.
* Due to the short time, ask your question after the lecture. Do not hesitate to ask your questions. I am here to help you.


## II. The objectives

### 1) Understand

**What do you mean ?:**
> Before the course, you have to dig into the bibliography given for each chapter. You need to understand the main concepts before the courses in order to profit from them.

**Must I read all the bibliography?:**
> It's not necessary. We designed the bibliography to be larger than what you can use before the course. Because you are limited in time, you need to select the resources you work on. This is why you only have to understand mains concepts.

**Why giving this large amount of resources ?:**
> To help you to dig more into the subject. These resources will help you if you want to know more about each chapter. Because of curiosity, or the need for a project

**Will you evaluate our understanding ?:**
> Yes. For each course week, you will have a quiz at the end of the week.

### 2) Practice

> In respect of our "Learning by doing" pedagogy, you will have to practice what you are learning during the course and after it.

> Concerning the practice after the course, you will have an assignment. It will take the shape of a specification book. You will have 2 months to do it.



## III. The chapters

### 1) Discrete components

**Contents:**
* Electricity and wire
* Resistor
* Capacitor
* Inductor
* Transformer, relai & Switch
* RLC circuit

**Interest:**
>Initiate to basics of electricity, passive components, laws, and basic circuits. This is the beginner level.

### 2) Semi-conductors

**Contents:**
* NP liaisons
* Diodes
* Transistors

**Interest:**
> Initiate to semi-conductors and how they are use in basic circuits. The first step to digital electronic

### 3) Logic gates & digital electronic

**Contents:**
* Transistors & logic gates
* Logic gates
* Logic assembly
* Digital Electronic

**Interest:**
> Use of semi-conductors to create logic gates. Introduction to digital electronic, binary, and computer basics.

### 4) Electronic design & manufacturing

**Contents:**
* Electronic tools
* THT (Through Hole Technology) components
* SMD (Surface Mount Device) components
* Integrated circuit (IC)
* Circuit design

**Interest:**
> First, an introduction to the different tools you will use during your electronic projects.
>
> Secondly, an introduction to the manufacturing process of electronic.

### 5) Microcontrolers and basic register programming

**Contents:**
* Architectures
* Memory map
* Hardware modules
* Protocoles (I2S / SPI/ etc)
* programming

**Interest:**
> Here, you will understand the transition from digital electronics to computer programming. You will learn the basics of a computer, the architectures, and how to program them.
